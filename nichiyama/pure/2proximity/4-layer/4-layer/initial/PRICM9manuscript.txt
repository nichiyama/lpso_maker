We made up two senarios and assessed each step by the first principles calculations. 
First senario is Stacking Fault initiate. 
In first senario, we predicted solute atoms are trapped Stacking Fault after introduced periodically them.
Second senario is Solute Ordering initiate.
In second senario, we pridicted Stacking Fault traps solute atoms.
And, solute atoms are sweeped out from Stacking Fault and condense at 4-layer.
Condensed atoms initiate Stacking faults.

We assesed whether condensed solutions initiate Stacking Faults or not.
This graph is Stacking Fault energy of Mg 72.
And, This graph is Stacking Fault energy of Mg 70 Zn 1 Y 1 that Zn and Y replace with Mg at Stacking Fault layer.
Peek of Mg 70 Zn 1 Y 1 graph is lower than Mg 72 graph.
So, we guessed impurities like Zn and Y are factors introducing Stacking Faults.

Next, we researched Interaction between cluster and solution.
The solution is inserted in 1st through 6th layer separating from the cluster or the stacking fault.
When Zn replace with Mg, total energys don't show critical energy changes.
But, When Y replacs with Mg, total energys show monotonous decrease.
The graphs shows Zn is not influenced by cluster and Y is influenced by cluster.
And Zn-Y pair stable in same layer.
So, Zn stable a long distance layer from cluster or Stacking Fault.

We inspect cluster stability.
First, we assesed cluster stability when some clusters exists in same layer.
As a result,
